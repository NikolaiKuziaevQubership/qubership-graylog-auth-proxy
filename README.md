# qubership-graylog-auth-proxy

This is a proxy that allows you to authenticate users for the Graylog server using third-party databases
(for example, Active Directory) or OAuth authorization service (for example, Keycloak).

    B -->|auth request| C[LDAP or OAuth]
    C -->|auth response| B
    B -->|successful login| D[Graylog]
```

## Features

* Authentication and authorization based on: LDAP, LDAPS, LDAP with StartTLS protocols (OpenLDAP, Active Directory),
  OIDC + OAuth 2.0
* Proxy automatically creates user in Graylog with the same name as in the LDAP database or OAuth server
* Opportunity to create Graylog user with the certain roles according to group of the LDAP user or to role(-s)
  of the user from the OAuth server
* Opportunity to share Graylog streams to user according to their group in the LDAP database or to role(-s)
  of the user from the OAuth server
* Proxy creates users in the Graylog server with the random password to prevent authentication from bypassing the proxy.
  These passwords are rotated every `x` days (`3` by default) (available only for the LDAP mode at this moment)

## How it works

During working process qubership-graylog-auth-proxy connects to an SSO provider and handles all requests that are going to the
Graylog server. If user wants to access to the Graylog UI via the proxy, he/she needs to enter credentials for a user
from SSO provider. Then the proxy verifies these creds and adds user with the same username and random password
to Graylog and gives him the rights (attaches roles and shares several streams) based on the proxy configuration and
some attributes of the user from SSO provider. If the user is already exist in the Graylog, qubership-graylog-auth-proxy tries
to update it.

After successful authentication qubership-graylog-auth-proxy adds a trusted header with the username to each request that goes to
Graylog to avoid internal Graylog authentication. The proxy connect to LDAP only once and then uses cookies to identify
users for better performance. That mechanism work until cookies expired.

Regardless of this, the proxy runs the script for rotation of random passwords for users created in the Graylog and
deleting users that no longer exist in the SSO provider. This script runs every few days (3 days by default).

Also, qubership-graylog-auth-proxy have a metrics endpoint `/metrics` with Prometheus metrics.

LDAP mode:

        Auth Proxy ->> Graylog: Add permissions and share Streams according to LDAP group
        Graylog ->> Auth Proxy: Permissions successfully added

OAuth mode:

    Auth Proxy ->> User: Redirect to OAuth server (with State and Scopes)
    User ->> OAuth server: Opens redirect URL
    OAuth server ->> User: Present authorization UI
    User ->> OAuth server: Enter credentials
    OAuth server ->> Auth Proxy: Redirect with Authorization Code (with State)
    Auth Proxy ->> Auth Proxy: Check the State
    Auth Proxy ->> OAuth server: Present Authorization Code (with Client ID and Secret)
    OAuth server ->> Auth Proxy: Return Access Token
    Auth Proxy ->> OAuth server: Request info about user (username, groups, roles, etc.) with Access Token
    OAuth server ->> Auth Proxy: Return info about user in JSON format
    Auth Proxy ->> Graylog: Verify that the user exists in Graylog as a local user
    alt exist
        Graylog ->> Auth Proxy: User is existing
        Auth Proxy ->> Graylog: Request user Roles and shared Streams
        Graylog ->> Auth Proxy: Return Roles and shared Streams
        Auth Proxy ->> Graylog: Proxy pass user with specific HTTP header

        Graylog ->> Auth Proxy: User successfully created
        Auth Proxy ->> Graylog: Add permissions and share Streams according to user info from the OAuth server
        Graylog ->> Auth Proxy: Permissions successfully added
        Auth Proxy ->> Graylog: Proxy pass user with specific HTTP header
